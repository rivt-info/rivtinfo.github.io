2.2 rivt-zip
=============


rivt-zip

rivt-zip is a portable version of the rivt framework including Python, VSCode
and all of their required libraries and extensions. It is contained in a single
folder that can be run from a USB drive or any other folder on your
computer. Its primary limitation is the lack of ability to upgrade the components.
