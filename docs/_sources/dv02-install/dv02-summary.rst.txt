2. Installation
==================   


The rivt framework includes:

**VSCode** with extensions for document editing and collaboration

**Python** and libraries for analysis and formatting

The framework is often extended to include:

**Git** and **GitHub** for version control and collaboration

**LaTeX** for precise typesetting

**QCAD** for diagramming

The framework may be installed in several different ways. The choice of
installation method depends on the need for control and integration.


#. :doc:`rivt-sys </dv02-install/rivtsys>` 
    a user controlled installation of the *rivt framework* 

#. :doc:`rivt-zip </dv02-install/rivtzip>`
    a single folder portable version of the rivt framework including 
    Python, VSCode and all of the required libraries and extensions


#. :doc:`rivt-uv </dv02-install/rivtuv>` - 
    a single command installation of rivtlib in an isolated environment that 
    can also be fully deleted with a single command. *rivt-uv* requires the 
    installation of uv, a Python package manager. This is the recommended 
    installation method for most users.
