.. dropdown:: Which open source license applies to the *rivt framework*?  
    
    **VSCode** - Visual Studio Code uses a proprietary Microsoft license for
    the compiled product, allowing free use for development, testing and
    commercial applications. The source code ("Code - OSS") is under the MIT
    license. You can use VS Code freely for any purpose, including commercial
    projects, but some bundled extensions or specialized components
    (connections to the Microsoft servers and marketplace) may have different
    terms. Most extentions in the Marketplace use the MIT license.

    VSCodium is a fully open source alternative that removes Microsoft's
    proprietary components and built-in telemetry. However its extension 
    marketplace is less complete.
    
    **LaTeX** - LaTeX is released under the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) 
    for LaTeX components and MIT and BSD variants for many core utilities
    and packages. 
    
    **QCAD** - The QCAD source code is distributed under the open source
    license GPLv3 with exceptions to allow proprietary extensions.

    **Git** - The Git software is released under the GNU General
    Public License Version 2.0 (GPLv2).
