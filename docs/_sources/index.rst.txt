**rivt**
=========

is an open source markup language and framework for writing and publishing
engineering documents. 

**rivt** inputs are :doc:`text files <dv03markup/markup>` (.py). 

**rivt** outputs are :doc:`doc files <dv04docs/documents>` 
(documents) formatted as utf8-text, PDF or HTML files. The same input is used 
for each type of output. Groups of docs are  organized as reports.  This site 
is an example of a rivt HTML report.

The open source framework for **rivt** is described in the 
:doc:`Installation <dv02install/install>` and 
:doc:`Reports <dv05reports/reports>` sections.
