.. _rivt-uv:

**[2t]** uv install 
----------------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <hr>

The *rivtlib* package is not uploaded to PyPI yet. The *rivtuv* installation 
method is recommended for most users.

.. topic:: Step 1. Install uv

    Install `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#pypi>`_. 

    The recommended method for installing *uv* is:

    Windows from the command line:

    .. code-block:: bash
        
        winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e 

    macOS and Linux from the command line:

    .. code-block:: bash
        
        curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

.. topic:: Step 2. Create an isolated rivt environment

    After installing *uv*, download and run the following command or shell file.
    
    Windows:  :download:`rivtuv.cmd </_downloads/rivtuv.cmd>` 

    OSX and Linux: :download:`rivtuv.sh </_downloads/rivtuv.sh>`
    
    This installs an isolated *rivt* environment and example files in the 
    xxxx folder in the users *Home* directory. Additional install script detaild 
    can be found `here <https://github.com/rivt-info/rivtuv-install/edit/main/>`_.
