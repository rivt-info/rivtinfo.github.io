API functions start in column one. rivt-strings are indented four spaces (for
legibility and code folding).A rivt doc is assembled by each function in order
of the input order. Each function also, optionally, defines a doc section.

::

    import rivtlib.rivtapi as rv
    
    rv.R("""Run function | pass; redact | nocolor; color code
    
        The Run function processes shell commands.
    
        Each API function defines a new document section. The first line is a
        heading line which includes the section heading, a parameter for redacting
        sections in a mirror file intended for public sharing, and a parameter for
        the background color for the section. If the section heading is preceded by
        two dashes (--) the section is continued from the prior section without
        introducting a new number.
        
        File formatting follows pep8 and ruff. API functions start in column one.
        All other lines are indented 4 spaces to facilitate section folding,
        bookmarks and legibility.

    rv.I("""Insert function | pass; redact | nocolor 
    
        The Insert function formats static objects including images, tables,
        equations and text.
    
        ||text | data01/describe.txt | rivt     
    
        The table command inserts and formats tabular data from csv or xls files.
        The _[t] tag formats and autonumbers table titles.
    
        A table title  _[t]
        || table | data/file.csv | 60,r
    
        The image command inserts and formats image data from png or jpg files. The
        _[f] tag formats and autonumbers figures.
            
        A figure caption _[f]
        || image | data/f1.png | 50
    
        Two images may be placed side by side as follows:
    
        The first figure caption  _[f]
        The second figure caption  _[f]
        || image | private/image/f2.png, private/image/f3.png | 45,35
        
        The tags _[x] and _[s] format LaTeX and sympy equations:
    
        \gamma = \frac{5}{x+y} + 3  _[x] 
    
        x = 32 + (y/2)  _[s]
    
        """)
    
    rv.V("""Values function |  pass; redact | nocolor 
    
        The Values fucntion evaluates variables and equations. 
        
        The equal tag declares a value. A sequence of declared values terminated
        with a blank line is formatted as a table.
        
        Example of assignment list _[t]
        f1 = 10.1 * LBF |LBF, N| a force value
        d1 = 12.1 * IN  |IN, CM| a length value
    
        An equation tag provides an equation description and number. A colon-equal
        tag assigns a value and specifies the result units and the output decimal
        places printed in the result and equation.
    
        Example equation - Area of circle  _[e]
        a1 := 3.14(d1/2)^2 | IN^2, CM^2 | 1,2
    
        || declare | data01/values02.csv
        
        The declare command imports values from the csv file written by rivt when
        processing values in other documents. 
    
        """)
    
    rv.T("""Tools function | pass; redact | nocolor
    
        The Tools function processes Python code.

    rv.X("""Any text 
    
        Changing a function to X skips evaluation of that function. Its purposes
        include review commenting and debugging.
    
        """) 
    
    rv.W("""Write function | pass; redact | nocolor
    
        The Write function generates docs and reports.
