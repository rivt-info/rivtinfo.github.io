4.2 - Documents 
========================

*rivt files* and *source files* are typically stored in *rivt project folders*
and subfolders. *Reports* are assembled from and written to files in the
*project folder* which has the top level structure of:

.. code-block:: bash
 
    [rivt]-Project-Label/             Project Folder 
        ├── [dv01-]divlabel/          division folder
        ├── [dv02-]divlabel/          division folder
        
        ...

        ├── [public]/                 public rivt files
        ├── [reports]/                reports and docs
        ├── [source]/                 source files      
        └── README.txt                text report 


A expanded example of a *project folder* is :doc:`here </dv04-reports/rv0402-folders>`

*rivt files* are processed one at a time. Sources used in a *doc* are read
from *source* subfolders. *Docs* that are part of *reports* are written to
subfolders of the *reports* folder.


**[01]** Single Docs

For a simple document that will not be part of a report, a *single doc* may
also be published using only the local folder, without reference to the project
folder. In this case all of the source files are read from, and *docs* are
written to, the same folder as the *rivt file*.

A *single doc* is published by including the following:

#. For all *commands* with a path, including | DOCS | ,the path is specified 
   as *rvlocal*.
#. For the *Value* API function (*rv.V*) add the *rvlocal* parameter to any
   other write parameters. Separate parameters with a comma.
#. Ensure that any source files for the *doc* are in the local folder.

Any *rivt file* can be converted to a *single doc* using the above steps. The
text, PDF and HTML *docs* will be written to the local file using standard
format settings built into *rivtlib*. The formatting is simpler than *report
formatting* - which may be modified by the author on a per report basis.

**[02]** Reports

*Reports* are assembled from *docs*, which are produced by *rivt files* - each
*rivt file* produces one *doc*. A typical workflow for writing *reports* is to
start with a similar *report* and then edit it file by file to produce a group
of *docs*.

A *report* is generated by editing and running a script with a number of
settings that specify *doc* assembly and naming overrides. A setting is
provided to regenerate all *docs* before *report* assembly. The *report*
written to a subfolder of the *reports* folder.

A typical report generating script is shown below. Note that many aspects of
report appearance are already determined at the *doc* level.

.. code-block:: python

    #! python

    from rivtlib.rvreport import *  # noqa: F403

    """ generate a rivt report

    Sample report generating and config file. The report generating file must
    located in rivtdocs/reports/. The report output file is written to the same
    folder. Duplicate report file names are incremented, not overwritten. 

    Run this Python file to generate a rivt report. Copy and rename the file to
    save custom report settings. See rivtdocs/styles/rivt.ini for additional
    settings.

    A flag determines whether the report is assembled from existing doc files or
    whether docs are regenerated prior to assembly. (see "report type and paths"
    below). If a rivt or doc file is specified for inclusion and not found a
    warning is given but the report is still assembled.

    A rivt report organizes rivt folders into divisions, and rivt doc files as
    subdivisions. rivt doc numbers define this structure. Default titles for
    subdivisions and divisions are generated by stripping the doc or div number
    from the file or folder name and replacing underscores with spaces. The default
    titles may be overridden (see "optional rename" below). """
