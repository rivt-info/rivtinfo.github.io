    """ generate a rivt report

    Sample report generating and config file. The report generating file must
    located in rivtdocs/reports/. The report output file is written to the same
    folder. Duplicate report file names are incremented, not overwritten. 

    Run this Python file to generate a rivt report. Copy and rename the file to
    save custom report settings. See rivtdocs/styles/rivt.ini for additional
    settings.

    A flag determines whether the report is assembled from existing doc files or
    whether docs are regenerated prior to assembly. (see "report type and paths"
    below). If a rivt or doc file is specified for inclusion and not found a
    warning is given but the report is still assembled.

    A rivt report organizes rivt folders into divisions, and rivt doc files as
    subdivisions. rivt doc numbers define this structure. Default titles for
    subdivisions and divisions are generated by stripping the doc or div number
    from the file or folder name and replacing underscores with spaces. The default
    titles may be overridden (see "optional rename" below). """
