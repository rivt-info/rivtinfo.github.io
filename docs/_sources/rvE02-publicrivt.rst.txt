**E.2 Public rivt files**
==========================


**[1t]** Overview
----------------------------------------

A feature of *rivt* is fine-grained control over public sharing of all or parts
of a rivt file. *Public rivt files* are generated by *rivtlib* on a section by
section basis defined by the API header substring. Each API function defines a
section and has a public/private setting in the header. Sections are private by
default (see :ref:`Header substring`).

.. code-block:: python

    rv._("""Section Label | doc;stored, private;public, section;merge

         Content substring indented 4 spaces
        
        ...
        
        """)

Sections written to the public rivt file in the */public* folder are written to
a file with a file name taken from the rivt file:

        .. code-block:: text

            rvAnn-filename.py

is modified to the same file name with an additional hyphen.
        
        .. code-block:: text

            rv-Ann-filename.py

The public folder may be uploaded to a GitHub repo. When downloaded the extra
hyphen may be removed.

**[2t]** Public Folder

For each rivt file that is published a corresponding *public rivt file* is
written to the *public* folder. The default contents of the file are the API
rivt string headers. If the header parameter *public* is included in the
header, the rivt string content is also written to the *public rivt file*.

.. code-block:: bash

    [rivt]-Report-Label/                Report Folder Name
        ├── [rv101-]filename1.py        | rivt file
        ├── [rv102-]filename2.py        | rivt file
        ├── [rv201-]filename3.py        | rivt file
        ├── [rv202-]filename4.py        | rivt file 

        ...

        ├── [public]/                   || public rivt files 
            ├── rv-101-filename1.py              
            ├── rv-102-filename1.py              
            ├── rv-201-filename3.py  
            └── rv-202-filename4.py


The *public folder* can be uploaded to a public repository and updated with
Git as the project develops.
