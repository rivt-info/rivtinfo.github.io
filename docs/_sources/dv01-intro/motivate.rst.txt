**1.1**  Motivation
=======================

**[01]**  Background
-------------------------

**rivt** development is motivated by a need for software that simplifies
engineering document reuse. Engineering documents typically include text,
tables, diagrams, equations and calculations from a variety of sources.
Although document software combining these elements is available, document
reuse on a wide scale for these programs is limited.

The limitations that **rivt** is designed to address can be summarized as:

- adoption is divided among many incompatible programs
- documents become inaccessible without continual program updates
- update costs are high
- there is limited cross-platform availability
- collaboration and version control is limited
- report generation is limited
  
The table below provides a feature comparison between representative
programs.
