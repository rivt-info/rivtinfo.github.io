1.1  Motivation
=======================

[01]  Background
-------------------------

**rivt** development is motivated by a need for software that simplifies
engineering document reuse. Engineering documents typically include text,
tables, diagrams, equations and calculations from a variety of sources.
Although software combining these elements is available, document reuse on a
wide scale is limited. The limitations can be summarized as:

- use is divided among many incompatible programs
- older documents are inaccessible without frequent software updates
- update costs are high
- software is not cross-platform 
- collaboration and version control is limited
- report generation is limited
  




    

[02] Feature Comparison
----------------------------------------

**rivt** is designed to address these limitations. The table below compares
relevant features between representative software.
