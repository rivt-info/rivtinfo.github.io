**1.1**  Motivation
=======================

**[01]**  Background
-------------------------

**rivt** development is motivated by a need for software that efficiently reuses
engineering documents. Engineering documents typically
include text, tables, diagrams, equations and calculations from a variety of
sources. Although document software combining these elements is available,
document reuse on a wide scale is limited. 

The deficiencies **rivt** is designed to address can be summarized as:

- market divided among many incompatible programs
- incompatible documents without continual updates
- high update costs
- limited cross-platform compatibility
- limited collaboration and version control
- limited report generation
  
The table below provides feature comparisons with representative software
programs.
