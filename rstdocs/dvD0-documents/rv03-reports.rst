**4.3** Reports
==================

**[1]** Files and Docs

The assembly and organization of a *rivt report* is inferred from:

#. The *rivt file* and *doc* name
#. The *project folder* names

.. topic:: Note: 
    
   In the examples below, brackets identify the fixed part of the file or
   folder name and are not included in the actual name.



A *rivt file* name has a *doc number* prefix:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    [rvss-]file-name.py
    
where ss is a two digit subdivision number. e.g., rv03-loads.py is subdivision
3 within a division folder. Each *rivt file* outputs a *doc file* with the same
*doc number* prefix. The *doc number* and *project folder structure* are used
to assemble and organize reports.


**[2]** Project Folders
---------------------------------------------------------------------

*rivt project folders* organize files used to generate *docs* and *reports*.
The files include *rivt files*, external source documents, settings,
and public/private files. The top level structure is shown below. The full
structure is shown :doc:`here</dvD0-documents/rv02-folders>`

.. code-block:: bash

    [rivt]-Project-Label/             Project Folder 
        ├── [dv01-]divlabel/          division folder
        ├── [dv02-]divlabel/          division folder

        ...

        ├── [public]/                 public rivt files
        ├── [reports]/                reports and docs
        ├── [source]/                 source files      
        └── README.txt                text report 


A *rivt file* may also generate a *single doc* that reads from and writes to the
local *rivt file* folder, independent of the *project folders*.

**[3]** Reports
----------------------------------------------------------

*Reports* are assembled from *docs* produced by *rivt files* - each *rivt file*
produces one *doc*. Each *doc* is a *subdivision* of a report.

A typical workflow for writing *reports* is to start with a similar *report*
and then edit it file by file to produce the group of *docs* needed for the
*report*.

The *report* is generated by editing and running a Python script with settings
that specify *doc* assembly parameters and default overrides. A setting is
provided to either regenerate all *docs* before *report* assembly or to
assemble from previously generated *docs*. The *report* is assembled and
written to a subfolder that depends on the specified format of the report.

A typical report generating script is shown below. Many aspects of
the *report* appearance are determined at the *doc* generating level.

.. code-block:: python

    #! python

    from rivtlib.rvreport import *  # noqa: F403

    """ generate a rivt report

    Sample report generating and config file. The report generating file must
    located in rivtdocs/reports/. The report output file is written to the same
    folder. Duplicate report file names are incremented, not overwritten. 

    Run this Python file to generate a rivt report. Copy and rename the file to
    save custom report settings. See rivtdocs/styles/rivt.ini for additional
    settings.

    A flag determines whether the report is assembled from existing doc files or
    whether docs are regenerated prior to assembly. (see "report type and paths"
    below). If a rivt or doc file is specified for inclusion and not found a
    warning is given but the report is still assembled.

    A rivt report organizes rivt folders into divisions, and rivt doc files as
    subdivisions. rivt doc numbers define this structure. Default titles for
    subdivisions and divisions are generated by stripping the doc or div number
    from the file or folder name and replacing underscores with spaces. The default
    titles may be overridden (see "optional rename" below). """
