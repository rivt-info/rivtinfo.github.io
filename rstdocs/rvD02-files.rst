**rivt file**

*rivt files* are written by the author. Each *rivt file* has a prefix that
specifies the division label and subdivision number of the published *doc*.
*rivt reports* are assembled using *doc numbers* that organize the report into
divisions and subdivisions. The d*subdivision* name is taken from the
name that follows the *doc number*. It may be overridden in the *API
Meta function*. *Division* names are specified in the :term:`report script`.


The *doc number* prefix includes a single digit capital alphanumeric division
label *D*, followed by a two digit subdivision number *ss*. For example:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    [rvDss-]file-name.py
    
    rvC02-Beam-Loads.py

where the default doc name is "Beam Loads" in subdivision 2 of division C.
Hyphens are stripped from file name.

.. topic:: Note: 

    The following files are read and written by *rivtlib* when processing a 
    *rivt file*.  Files are labeled by origin and folder. 

    **origin**: author input

    **folder**: *rivt-report-folder-name* 

    Refer to :doc:`markup <rvC01-markup>` for *command* details. 

**Run file**

A *run file* is a shell or command script executed using the | RUN |
command.

    **origin**: author input

    **folder**: *src/*  - or a user created subfolder of /src

    **API function**:  *rv.R*

**Insert file**

An *insert file* is an image, table or text file executed using 
the | IMAGE | , | TABLE | , or | TEXT | command.

    **origin**: author input

    **folder**: *src/* - or a user created subfolder of /src

    **API function**:  *rv.I*

**Value file**

A *value file* is a *csv* file that defines variable values. It is imported
using the \| VALUE \| command. Values defined by equations and a _[[VALUES]]
block are written to a file with the name composed of the *doc* and *section*
number. The file may be read by other *rivt files*.

    Read

    **origin**: author input
    
    **folder**: *src/Values*  -  or a user created subfolder of /src
    
    **API function**:  *rv.V* 

    Write

    **origin**: program output
    
    **folder**: *src/Values*
    
    **API function**:  *rv.V* 


**Tool file**

*Tool files* can be executed by | PYTHON | , | HTML | , | RST | 
or | LATEX | commands. They may be used for analysis and generation of text, 
tables, images and other formatted content.  Executing a tool file may:

- define functions and classes for use in the *rivt file*
- generate images, tables and text for inclusion in the *doc*
- insert markup text into the *doc*

    Read
    
    **origin**: author input
    
    **folder**: *src/Tools*  or a user created subfolder of /src
    
    **API function**:  *rv.T*

    Write
    
    **origin**: program output
    
    **folder**: *src/Tools* 
    
    **API function**:  *rv.T*

**Doc file**

Each *rivt file* outputs a *doc file* with the same *doc name and number* and
the selected *doc type* suffix. *Doc* files are written to the *publish folder*
as text, PDF or HTML files using | PUBLISH | command.

PDF files may be prepended or appended to the *doc* using the | APPEND |
command.

    **origin**: program output
    
    **folder**: *src/* - or a user created subfolder of /src
    
    **API function**:  *rv.D* 

**Report file**

A *report file* is generated by the Python *report script* and is written to
the designated *publish subfolder*. The *report file name* is taken from the
*report folder name* unless specified in the *report script*.

    **origin**: program output
    
    **folder**: */publish/* subfolder

**Report script**

The *report script* is a Python file that assembles the *report*. It specifies
the *docs* that should be included, whether the *rivt files* should be
re-executed and other format settings.

    **origin**: author input
    
    **folder**: */publish*

**Public rivt file**

    **origin**: program output
    
    **folder**: */public*

A public rivt file is a copy of the *rivt file* that includes all of the
sections marked as *public* in the *header*. It has the same name as the *rivt
file* with an added hyphen between "rv" and the docnumber e.g.
*rv-Dss-filename.py*

**Log file**


*Log files* are written to the *log folder*. They include: 

- a backup of the rivt file
- a file listing the execution steps when processing the *rivt file* 
- a file listing each API function call with the header.

    **origin**: program output
    
    **folder**: */logs*

The *rivt report folder* organizes *logs*, *public rivt files*, *sources*,
*docs* and *reports*. The top level folders are shown below. 

**Folder Key**

- Required folder and file prefix names are shown in brackets [ ]. 
- Single vertical bar ( | ) identifies files provided by the report author. 
- Double vertical bar ( || ) identifies files written by rivtlib 
- Four vertical bars ( |||| ) are a mix of author and rivtlib written files


.. code-block:: bash

    [rivt-]Report-Label/                Report Folder Name
        ├── [rv101-]filename1.py        | rivt file
        ├── [rv102-]filename2.py        | rivt file
        ├── [rv201-]filename3.py        | rivt file
        ├── [rv202-]filename4.py        | rivt file

        └── README.txt                  || Searchable text report 

.. topic:: Note:

    When a *rivt file* is processed, the required folders are checked. If a
    required folder is missing it is created. 

The full report folder structure is :ref:`here. <full-report-folder>`

**[3]** Reports
----------------------------------------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <hr>

A :term:`report` is assembled from *docs*. Each :term:`rivt file` compiles to 
a *doc* organized by division and subdivision specified by .

A typical workflow for writing *reports* is to start with a similar *report*
and then edit the *rivt files* to produce new *docs*.

A *report* is generated by running a Python report script with settings
that specify assembly parameters and override defaults. One setting
provides the option to either regenerate all *docs* or to
assemble the report from previously generated *docs*.  Most aspects of
the *report* appearance are determined at when generating *docs*.

An example script is shown below.

.. code-block:: python

    #! python

    from rivtlib.rvreport import *  # noqa: F403

    """ generate a rivt report

    Sample report generating and config file. The report generating file must
    located in rivtdocs/reports/. The report output file is written to the same
    folder. Duplicate report file names are incremented, not overwritten. 

    Run this Python file to generate a rivt report. Copy and rename the file to
    save custom report settings. See rivtdocs/styles/rivt.ini for additional
    settings.

    A flag determines whether the report is assembled from existing doc files or
    whether docs are regenerated prior to assembly. (see "report type and paths"
    below). If a rivt or doc file is specified for inclusion and not found a
    warning is given but the report is still assembled.

    A rivt report organizes rivt folders into divisions, and rivt doc files as
    subdivisions. rivt doc numbers define this structure. Default titles for
    subdivisions and divisions are generated by stripping the doc or div number
    from the file or folder name and replacing underscores with spaces. The default
    titles may be overridden (see "optional rename" below). """
