**rivt** is an open source markup language and framework for writing and
publishing engineering documents. Inputs are (:doc:`rivt files <dv03markup/syntax>`) 
that others may edit. The same *rivt files* are used for different output types 
(:doc:`docs <dv04reports/types>`). Outputs can be utf8-text, PDF or HTML.

The rivt framework is described in the 
:doc:`Installation <dv02install/methods>` and :doc:`Reports <dv04reports/types>` 
divisions. Reports are groups of *docs* organized within divisions.  This site i
s an example of a rivt HTML report.
