#. :doc:`rivt-sys </dv02-install/rivtsys>` : 
    a user controlled installation of  *rivt* and *frameworks*

#. :doc:`rivt-zip </dv02-install/rivtzip>` :
    a single folder portable version of the *rivt framework* including 
    Python, VSCode and all of the required libraries and extensions


#. :doc:`rivt-uv </dv02-install/rivtuv>` :
    a single command installation of *rivt* in an isolated environment that 
    can also be fully deleted with a single command. *rivt-uv* requires the 
    installation of *uv*, a Python package manager. This is the recommended 
    installation method for most users. VSCode and extensions are installed 
    separately.
