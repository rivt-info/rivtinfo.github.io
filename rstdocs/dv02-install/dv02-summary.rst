2. Installation
==================   


The rivt framework includes:

**VSCode** with extensions for document editing and collaboration

**Python** and libraries for analysis and formatting

The framework is often extended to include:

**Git** and **GitHub** for version control and collaboration

**LaTeX** for precise typesetting

**QCAD** for diagramming

The framework may be installed in several different ways. The choice of
installation method depends on the need for control and integration.


#. :doc:`rivt-sys </dv02-install/rivtsys>` - *rivt-sys* is a user 
    controlled installation of the *rivt framework*. 

#. :doc:`rivt-zip </dv02-install/rivtzip>` - *rivt-zip* is a portable version of 
    the rivt framework including Python, VSCode and all of the required 
    libraries and extensions. 


#. :doc:`rivt-uv </dv02-install/rivtuv>` - *rivt-uv* requires the installation of 
    uv, a Python package manager, which then facilitates a single command 
    installation of rivt in an isolated environment that can be deleted with 
    a single command. The recommended installation method for most users is rivt-uv.
